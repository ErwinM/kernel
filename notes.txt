If we map pgdir and pgtables in identity mapped kernel space, we do not have
to deal with recursive page linking and changing and accessing pgdirs will
straight forward

Ramdisk
- get the location and size of the ram disk
- adjust placement_address
- write interface for initrd
- write the vfs (this will be the buffercache eventually..)

Implement starting of the first user program that starts the shell:
- implement system call interface  - DONE!
- implement userlib to use system call - DONE (kinda)
- implement reading from the ramdisk (readi), skip buffercache for now - DONE!
- implement exec - DONE!
- implement sys_write system call - DONE!
- write the first user program: hello world - DONE!
- implement namei for the ramdisk - DONE!

Get to a sh prompt:
- implement fork
- implement fork sys call
- implement keyboard driver
